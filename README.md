BFS inconsistently found the optimal solution and usually explored most of the cities in the map. 
Due to the iterations performed, DLS explored far more cities than the other algorithms, and performed worst at finding the optimal solution.
UCS and A* always found the optimal solution. A* on average expanded and explored one less city than UCS, making it slightly more efficient. Both are more efficient than BFS.
